     Project: Number 01
     Name: Find e to the Nth Digit 
     Goal: Just like the previous problem, but with e instead of PI. Enter a number and have the program generate e up to that many decimal places. Keep a limit to how far the program will go.

           My solutions are wrapped in HTML for ease of viewing and usage.
